## Local Setup Instructions

Prerequisites: You must have **Node.js** installed on your system.

### 1. Backend Setup

1.  Open your terminal and navigate to the `backend` folder:
    \`\`\`bash
    cd backend
    \`\`\`
2.  Install dependencies:
    \`\`\`bash
    npm install
    \`\`\`
3.  Start the backend server:
    \`\`\`bash
    npm start
    \`\`\`
    > The backend will run on \`http://localhost:5000\`. On the first run, the SQLite database `scheme_portal.db` will be auto-generated and seeded with 10 actual Central & Tamil Nadu schemes and the default admin user.

### 2. Frontend Setup

1.  Open a new terminal window and navigate to the `frontend` folder:
    \`\`\`bash
    cd frontend
    \`\`\`
2.  Install dependencies:
    \`\`\`bash
    npm install
    \`\`\`
3.  Start the Vite development server:
    \`\`\`bash
    npm run dev
    \`\`\`
    > This will output a local URL (e.g., \`http://localhost:5173\`). Open this URL in your browser.

## Deployment Instructions

### Backend (Node.js API)
1. Deploy the backend folder to a service like **Render**, **Railway**, or **Heroku**.
2. Make sure to define `JWT_SECRET` in your environment variables.
3. *Note on SQLite:* SQLite is a file-based database. For ephemeral platforms like Render or Heroku, the database file will be wiped on restart. In a production environment, migrate the connection to a PostgreSQL or MySQL database, or use a persistent disk volume for SQLite.

### Frontend (React / Vite)
1. Update the API URLs in the frontend code (e.g., in `LoginPage.jsx`, `RegisterPage.jsx`, etc.) from `http://localhost:5000` to your deployed backend URL.
2. Run the build command:
    \`\`\`bash
    npm run build
    \`\`\`
3. Deploy the resulting `dist/` folder to a service like **Vercel**, **Netlify**, or **GitHub Pages**. (Vercel and Netlify support Vite apps out-of-the-box and handle the build process automatically).
